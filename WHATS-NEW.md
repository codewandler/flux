<!--
  WHATS-NEW.md — the CUSTOMER changelog. Audience: people who USE flux, not people who
  build it. Voice rules:
    - Plain language, feature-first. Say what the user can now do or what behaves
      differently — never how it is implemented.
    - NO story IDs, NO crate names, NO internal jargon (engineering detail lives in
      CHANGELOG.md).
    - Per release, use only the sections that apply: "### New", "### Improved",
      "### Fixed", "### Action needed" (breaking or attention-worthy changes).
  This file is embedded into the `flux` binary and shown by `flux changelog`.
  `scripts/cut-release.sh` rolls [Unreleased] into the release section on every cut.

# What's new in flux

## [Unreleased]

### New

- `flux changelog` — see what changed in your version of flux, right from the terminal.
  Shows your installed version's highlights by default; `flux changelog --all` shows the
  full history, `flux changelog <version>` a specific release.
- Flux plans now run faster: independent read-only steps (file reads, searches, status
  checks) automatically run in parallel when it is provably safe — results, ordering,
  and approval behavior are exactly as before, just sooner.
- Repeated identical reads within a single turn are answered from a result cache instead
  of re-running the work. Anything that writes invalidates it, and every new turn starts
  fresh. Turn it off with `FLUX_OP_CACHE=off` if you ever need to.
- When a plan needs a small correction, the model can now send just the fix instead of
  re-writing the whole plan — repairs get faster and cheaper, with the same safety checks
  on the final plan.

### Improved

- Editor diagnostics got precise: warnings from the flux language server now point at the
  exact statement in your `.flux` file (unknown operations, unbound `$variables`, wrong
  argument counts) instead of just naming the problem.
- The language now accepts more real-world text: kebab-case flow names, dotted operation
  names, blank lines and comments between a header and its body, single-quoted strings in
  conditions, and scientific-notation numbers.

## [0.11.6] - 2026-07-09

### New

- The agent can discover and run your saved flows: put reusable `.flux` files in
  `.flux/flows` (project) or `~/.flux/flows` (global) and they become listable and
  runnable mid-conversation, with your inputs passed in safely.

### Improved

- Plans are now requested from the model in a leaner format by default — noticeably lower
  token usage and cost per turn, with the same quality.

### Fixed

- Reading a shared directory like `@global_ops` directly (not a file inside it) now works;
  previously global reusable operations could silently fail to load.

## [0.11.5] - 2026-07-09

### New

- Editor support grew: syntax highlighting for `.flux` files in Helix, Neovim, and Zed via
  a dedicated grammar, alongside the flux language server (completion, hover, diagnostics,
  formatting). See the "Editor support" docs page for setup.

## [0.11.4] - 2026-07-09

### New

- Every flux language feature now has a native, readable spelling — durable steps,
  approvals, rate limits, sagas with rollback, try/catch, and more no longer need JSON
  escape blocks. Your existing files keep working unchanged.
- A language server for `.flux` files (`flux-lsp`): error squiggles as you type,
  completion for operations and variables, hover documentation, and formatting.

## [0.9 – 0.11.3] - 2026-07

### Highlights

- flux became installable everywhere: prebuilt binaries for Linux/macOS/Windows and the
  full library stack published to crates.io.
- Time Machine: `flux replay`, `flux fork`, and `flux diff` — deterministically re-run,
  branch, and compare past sessions.
- Postgres storage option for teams that want sessions and events in a shared database.
- Signed plugin packs (`flux plugin install gitlab|slack|kubernetes|…`) with verified
  downloads, plus OAuth login for plugins that need it (`flux auth login <plugin>`).
- Sub-agents, A2A server support, budgets/usage reporting with real pricing, and a large
  set of built-in data-transform operations.
