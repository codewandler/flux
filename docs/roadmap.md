# flux — roadmap & status

Status as of **0.1.1 (2026-06-25)**: 29 crates, **169 tests**, a permanently green gate (tests,
clippy `-D warnings`, fmt, the `flux-codegate` layering lint). See [CHANGELOG.md](../CHANGELOG.md)
for the released history and [architecture.md](architecture.md) for the design.

## Delivered

The build proceeded breadth-first (every surface exists as a crate) and was then hardened in depth.

**Foundations & breadth (M0–M5)** — the workspace + layering lint; the content/message/streaming
model; the provider layer (wire codec × credential; five providers; credential store with PKCE login
and CLI-credential import; `provider/model` routing); the guarded IO boundary and the mandatory safety
envelope; built-in tools; SQLite sessions; the context projector; skills; markdown roles; multi-agent
orchestration; JS hooks; subprocess plugins; the SDK, HTTP server, integrations, browser/web egress,
datasource/RAG, evidence, and the OIDC identity seam.

**Hardening (M6–M9)** — provider retry/backoff; config loading + persistence; the authorization
policy wired into the envelope (default-deny + a usable local default); real secret redaction;
evidence + destructive-op escalation; capability & integration depth (`glob`/`grep`, `web_fetch`,
`search`, plugins-as-tools with host-capability callbacks, plugin lifecycle, skill activation,
policy-bounded sub-agents); streaming everywhere (CLI/TUI tokens, server SSE, in-TUI approval modal);
cancellation; autopilot (`/pd` dependency waves, `/goal`, `/loop`); context compaction; the layering
lint; CI; Anthropic prompt caching; the OIDC claims→identity seam.

**Review remediation** — two adversarial review passes were run against the hardened code and every
confirmed finding fixed with a regression test:
- *Post-M8/M9 review (R1–R8)* — session-shape breakers (empty-assistant-on-cancel, compaction
  splitting a tool_use/tool_result pair), uninterruptible autopilot, and CI/cache nits.
- *Full-tree security review (0.1.1)* — sandbox-escape, plugin-capability, server-auth, env-leak,
  policy-approval, SSRF, redaction, OAuth-state, and a batch of panic/DoS/correctness fixes. See the
  `[0.1.1]` CHANGELOG entry for the itemized list.

## Standing pre-release gate (do this before every release)

A **live-provider smoke test** is the manual gate that the offline mock can't replace (the mock
doesn't enforce provider message-shape rules — which is exactly how the session-shape breakers
slipped through). With a real key (e.g. `anthropic/opus`), exercise:
- a one-shot (`flux -p`),
- an agentic file edit under the envelope (`flux --agent --yes`, scratch workspace),
- a multi-turn `--continue` that replays tool-call history,
- a compaction-then-continue past a tiny `FLUX_COMPACT_CHARS` (validates no 400 on the rewritten log),
- (semi-manual) a Ctrl-C mid-turn in the REPL, then a follow-up turn in the same session.

This is the next concrete task and should be scripted (`scripts/smoke-live.sh`) so it's repeatable.

## Next

**Environment-gated (need a live key or external infra):**
- Switch `openai`'s default wire from Chat to Responses, verified with a live round-trip.
- `web_search` server tool; live token-count endpoint.
- `cargo-dist` release binaries + the GitHub Actions release run.
- Wire a real OIDC IdP behind the existing `OidcIdentity` seam (the multi-user platform tier).

**Deferred behind existing seams (add on concrete demand):**
- A `deno_core` / `rustyscript` hook backend (async / TypeScript / npm) behind the `PreToolHook` seam.
- A `chromiumoxide` CDP browser tool (navigate/screenshot; needs Chrome) behind the `flux-browser` surface.

## Direction

Priority is **personal coding agent → reusable SDK → multi-user platform**, with **non-bypassable
safety** as the non-negotiable north star. See [vision.md](vision.md). The annotated original design
& planning document (with full milestone-by-milestone detail) is retained outside the repo by the
author; this roadmap is the in-repo canonical summary.
