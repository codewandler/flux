# D-31 drift report — schema↔handler mismatches found & fixed

The schemars migration makes each op's `input_schema` and its runtime parsing derive from
one typed Rust struct, so they can no longer drift. This report records the drifts the
migration surfaced — cases where the *old* hand-written JSON Schema already disagreed with
what the handler actually parses (extra/missing fields, required-vs-optional mismatches,
type mismatches). Each is now fixed by construction; the notes record what was wrong.

## Summary

- **In-process `ToolSpec` ops: ~36 sites across `flux-tools`, `flux-eval`, `flux-orchestrate`.**
  All now derive their schema from a `#[derive(Deserialize, JsonSchema)]` struct via
  `flux_spec::tool_input_schema::<T>()`. No `input_schema: json!({...})` remains (enforced by
  `crates/flux-tools/tests/no_manual_schema.rs`).
- **Handler single-source-of-truth status:** most handlers keep ad-hoc `&Value` parsing (the
  schema struct is `#[allow(dead_code)]`, schema-only). Full SSoT (handler parses the struct via
  `parse_params`) is wired for `write` (flux-tools) and `task` (flux-orchestrate). The rest are
  schema-only by design — the story's hard requirement is "no hand-written schemas"; full SSoT is
  a follow-up where the handler is a simple 1:1 field extraction.

## Drifts found

### flux-tools

- **`cargo_test` / `cargo_check` / `cargo_build` / `cargo_clippy` / `cargo_fmt`** — the old
  hand-written schemas carried a custom `"x-param-order"` array (positional binding order).
  `schemars` does not emit `x-param-order`, and L-09 (named-argument calls) made parameter order
  non-load-bearing, so the ordering extension is dropped entirely. The old
  `cargo_test_schema_declares_positional_order` test is replaced by a guard asserting the derived
  schema carries **no** `x-param-order`. **No semantic drift** — keys, optionality, and types
  match what `execute()` parses.
- **`edit`** — the old schema marked `replace_all` optional (no `"required"` entry); the
  handler reads it with `unwrap_or(false)`. The derived struct models it as `Option<bool>` with
  `#[serde(default)]` → `unwrap_or` semantics preserved. Aligned.
- **`read`** — the old schema used `oneOf` for `path` (string | array of strings); the derived
  struct models it as an `#[serde(untagged)] StringOrVec` enum, which schemars renders
  equivalently. `offset`/`limit` optional `u64` match the handler's `u64_arg(...).unwrap_or(...)`.
- **`git_*`, `patch`, `glob`, `grep`, `append`, `read_many`, `proc_run`, `bash`** — no drift:
  field names, required/optional, and types match the handler's `str_param`/`u64_arg`/array
  extraction exactly. `git_status` / `flux_reload` are no-arg ops (`struct FooInput {}`).

### flux-tools/reflect.rs

- **`op.register` — schema↔handler drift (documented, not yet unified).** The schema is derived
  from `RegisterCompositeInput` (`scope: RegisterScope` enum → lowercase `turn|session|project|
  global` in the schema), but the runtime parses a separate `CompositeRegisterRequest`
  (`flux-runtime`, `scope: String`). The schema is **richer** (enumerates allowed scope values;
  the runtime accepts any string and validates later). This is a benign drift — the schema is
  strictly more informative than the runtime type — and is recorded here rather than unified,
  because unifying would require deriving `JsonSchema` on `CompositeRegisterRequest` (in
  `flux-runtime`, an L2 crate) and losing the enum documentation. Tracked as a follow-up.
- **`plan` / `run_plan`** — validate-only structs (`PlanInput`, `RunPlanInput`): the schema is
  derived from them but `execute()` forwards the raw object to the host (the host seeds the
  planner from the object directly). No drift; the structs exist to give the model a typed schema.

### flux-eval

- **ops/git/gate/aggregate** — schemas migrated to typed structs; handlers keep the
  `coerce_json`/`arg` convention (JSON-string coercion: a `$var` arrives as a JSON-encoded
  string and is parsed on use). **Single-source-of-truth is deliberately deferred** here: a
  blanket `from_value` deserialize would break the coercion convention (a JSON-string arg would
  fail to deserialize as the struct). The structs are `#[allow(dead_code)]` schema-only. No
  schema↔handler drift was found — field names/optionality/types align with `arg`/`str_field`
  extraction.
- **`improvements_aggregate` / `change_implement` / `score_compare` / `score_compare_multi`** —
  the old schemas used dangling `$ref`s to `#/$defs/...` definitions that were **not present** in
  the input schema (broken refs the model would have seen as unresolved). The derived schemas use
  concrete `String` / `Vec<Value>` types. This is a **real fix**: the model now sees a valid,
  resolvable schema instead of a dangling reference.

### flux-orchestrate

- **`task`** — full single-source-of-truth (`TaskInput { role, task }` + `parse_params`). No
  drift; the old schema matched the handler.

## Out of scope (deferred / correctly non-manual)

- **Plugin `OperationSpec` ops (~275 across 18 plugins)** — built via host-kit's
  `so(json!({...}), json!([...]))` helper. Same migration pattern, but on the plugin side: add
  `read_op_typed`/`write_op_typed` to host-kit, `schemars` to each plugin crate, replace every
  `so(...)` + handler `Value` parsing with a typed struct. Tracked as a separate story.
- **`flux-lang/src/opspec.rs`** — the composite-op `OpSpec → JSON Schema` *generator* (it
  *produces* schemas programmatically; that's its job, not a hand-written op schema).
- **Provider `json!({"type":"object"})` sites** (`flux-providers` tests / MCP passthrough
  `ToolDef`s) — not real `ToolSpec` op declarations.
- **`flux-cli/plugin_skill.rs`** + **`flux-plugin/bin/*`** — test/example code, not registered ops.

# D-36 drift report — plugin OperationSpec schema↔handler mismatches

The plugin-side continuation of D-34: each migrated plugin's `OperationSpec.input_schema` is
derived from a typed `#[derive(Deserialize, schemars::JsonSchema)]` struct via
`host_kit::read_op_typed::<T>` / `write_op_typed::<T>`, instead of a hand-written
`so(json!({...}), json![...]))` literal. The structs are schema-only (handlers keep their
existing extractors — the D-34 schema-only precedent); schemars' `Option<T>` → `["T","null"]`
representation is the repo-wide convention (D-34 already adopted it on the crate side), so the
derived JSON is **demonstrably equivalent**, not byte-identical, to the legacy literal. The
contract (fields, required set, base types, enum value sets) is asserted per migrated plugin by
an inline `schema_contract` test, and a workspace guard
(`plugins/host-kit/tests/no_manual_plugin_schema.rs`, scoped to `MIGRATED_PLUGINS`) fails on a
reintroduced `so(json!{...})`.

This section records the drifts the migration surfaced in each plugin — cases where the *old*
hand-written schema already disagreed with what the handler actually parses. Each is preserved
as-is (the struct encodes the legacy schema verbatim) so the migration is a pure schema-source
change, **not** a contract change; fixing the drift is a separate story.

## Migrated so far

- **`homer`** (8 ops). Guard-scoped. Contract test: `homer` `schema_contract::*`.

### homer

- **`homer.call.list`** — handler drift (handler wider than schema). `op_call_list` shares
  `build_search_filters` with `homer.search`, so it also reads `ua`, `method`, and `call_id`
  from the input — but the legacy `homer.call.list` schema never advertised those fields. The
  model therefore cannot filter `call.list` by `ua`/`method`/`call_id`; those reads are silent
  no-ops for this op. The `CallListInput` struct omits them to preserve the contract.
- **`homer.call.show`** — handler drift (schema wider than handler). The legacy schema
  advertises a `render` field (`enum: ["svg"]`) but `op_call_show` never reads it — the op
  always renders the SVG ladder unconditionally. `CallShowInput` keeps `render: Option<Render>`
  so the derived schema still advertises it (dead param), preserving the contract.
- All other `homer` ops (`test`, `search`, `call.qos`, `call.analyze`, `pcap.export`,
  `alias.list`): no schema↔handler drift — field sets and `required` match the handler reads.

## Representation notes (not drift — expected schemars behaviour)

- Optional fields serialize as `{"type": ["<T>", "null"]}` and are omitted from `required`
  (schemars 0.8 default). The legacy `so(...)` form wrote `{"type": "<T>"}` and `"required": []`
  explicitly. These are semantically equivalent for flux's runtime, which does not validate
  input against the schema (handlers parse leniently and ignore unknown keys).
- Enums serialize as a top-level `definitions` entry referenced by `$ref` (and wrapped in
  `anyOf` with `null` when the field is `Option<Enum>`), instead of an inline
  `{"type":"string","enum":[...]}`. The enum value set is unchanged.
- Empty-input structs serialize as `{"type":"object"}` (no `properties`/`required` keys) rather
  than `{"type":"object","properties":{},"required":[]}`. Equivalent.
- `additionalProperties` is not emitted (schemars default), matching the legacy `so(...)` form
  and the handlers' ignore-unknown-keys behaviour.

## Not yet migrated (tracked in `docs/stories/D-36-schemars-plugin-op-schemas.md`)

`gitlab`, `grafana`, `docker`, `huggingface`, `opsgenie`, `homer`✓, `asterisk`, `sql`,
`slack`, `websearch`, `jira`, `confluence`, `kubernetes`, `loki`, `prometheus`,
`alertmanager`, `aws`. Several use `flex_str`/`flex_i64` string-or-number coercion; their
handlers stay (schema-only struct, D-34 precedent) and any drift they surface will be recorded
here as they migrate.

# D-37 drift report — homer call.analyze parity port

Ported `homer.call.analyze` from the fluxplane reference
(`~/projects/fluxplane/fluxplane-plugins/homer/analyze.go`). The flux op was a stripped-down stub
(seed-by-`call_id` only; extracted correlation values but no fan-out / multi-leg analysis). It now
does the full multi-leg correlation: seed by `call_id` **or** `from_user`+`to_user`, fan out by the
seed caller + extra `numbers`, confirm legs by a shared `correlation_header` value + temporal
overlap, and additionally by involving an extra number.

## Parity status

- **Matched:** `from_user`, `to_user`, `numbers`, `headers`, `limit` params + the full
  multi-leg correlation logic (seed / fan-out / correlation-groups + temporal overlap /
  number-matching / merged multi-leg flow + ladder). Result shape matches fluxplane's
  `CallAnalyzeResult` (`seed_call_id` / `correlation_header` / `correlation_values` /
  `legs` / `leg_count` / `events` / `event_count` / `ladder`).
- **Architectural split (Gap A, intentionally NOT ported):** `endpoint_ref` per-call targeting —
  flux resolves `homer.endpoint` via `host.endpoint(...)` + `~/.flux/endpoints.toml` (D-29
  reference-IO), not the fluxplane per-call `EndpointRef`.
- **Deferred (real gaps, follow-up stories):**
  - **`render: svg` → `ladder_blob`:** the SVG sequence-diagram renderer (`RenderLadderSVG` in
    `ladder_svg.go`) is not ported. `render` stays advertised for parity but the handler ignores
    it; the result omits `ladder_blob`. Cross-cutting — `homer.call.show` advertises `render` too
    (and currently ignores it); one story should port the SVG renderer for both.
  - **`route` per leg:** `DeriveRoute`/`FormatRoute` (fluxplane `calls.go`) not ported; legs omit
    `route`. Minor.

## Tests

- `test_op_call_analyze_from_user_seed_and_correlation` — failing-first (old handler errored on
  missing `call_id`); now seeds by from/to, confirms a second leg by shared X-CID + temporal
  overlap (`matched_by: "correlation"`).
- `test_op_call_analyze_number_matching` — a fan-out leg involving an extra `numbers` entry is
  matched without the correlation header (`matched_by: "number"`).
- Existing `test_op_call_analyze` (call_id seed) still passes.
- `schema_contract` updated for the new `call.analyze` contract (10 props, `correlation_header`
  required; `call_id` is now optional — seed-by-call_id **or** from/to).
- `MockHost::with_http_seq` added (host-kit) for tests that hit the same URL twice with different
  responses (seed search then fan-out search).

### gitlab (D-36)

- **Schemars migration complete** (64 ops). All `so(json!{...}, json![...])` op schemas replaced
  by `#[derive(Deserialize, schemars::JsonSchema)]` structs via `read_op_typed::<T>` /
  `write_op_typed::<T>`; the local `so` helper is deleted. Handlers unchanged (schema-only
  structs — `flex_str`/`flex_i64`/`Value` extraction stays, D-34 precedent). `gitlab` added to
  `MIGRATED_PLUGINS`; guard green.
- **Contract test:** `gitlab` `schema_contract::derived_schemas_match_legacy_contract` encodes
  the pre-migration `so(...)` contract for all 64 ops (fields / required / base types) and
  asserts the derived schema matches. No schema↔handler drift was audited here beyond the
  contract lock (handlers kept as-is).
- **Representation notes:** `ref` fields use a raw identifier (`r#ref`); schemars serializes the
  JSON property as `ref` (unchanged). Untyped arrays (`{"type":"array"}` in the legacy `so(...)`)
  become `Vec<Value>` → `{"type":"array","items":{}}` (the contract test treats these as
  `ArrayAny`). Optional fields → `["T","null"]`, omitted from `required` (schemars default).
- **Fluxplane parity re-audit: deferred.** The 64-op surface was ported from fluxplane in D-14
  (gitlab 6→64); the schemars migration is verified faithful to flux's pre-migration contracts
  (the contract test), but a fresh field-by-field re-audit against
  `~/projects/fluxplane/fluxplane-plugins/gitlab/` Go source is a separate pass (lower risk than
  homer — D-14 already did the port; homer's gap was found because homer was audited, and gitlab
  deserves the same). Tracked in `.flux/plans/d36-plugin-schemars-parity-smoke.md`.

### slack (D-36)

- **Schemars migration complete** (30 ops). slack used a different hand-written shape than
  gitlab/homer: it inlined `json!({"type":"object","properties":{...},"required":[...]})` directly
  into `read_op`/`write_op` (no `so()` helper). All 30 inlined schemas replaced by schemars-derived
  structs via `read_op_typed::<T>` / `write_op_typed::<T>`; handlers unchanged (schema-only,
  `opt_str`/`Value` extraction stays, D-34 precedent). `slack` added to `MIGRATED_PLUGINS`.
- **Guard strengthened:** `no_manual_plugin_schema` now flags **both** hand-written shapes —
  `so(json!{...})` (gitlab/homer) and inline `json!({"type":"object",...})` (slack) — so a
  regression in any migrated plugin is caught regardless of which form it used. Verified
  failing-first for both shapes.
- **Contract test:** `slack` `schema_contract::derived_schemas_match_legacy_contract` encodes the
  pre-migration inline contract for all 30 ops and asserts the derived schema matches.
- **`slack.channel.mark-read`** — op name has a hyphen; the struct is `ChannelMarkReadInput`
  (hyphen stripped to a valid Rust ident). The JSON op name is unchanged.
- **Fluxplane parity re-audit: deferred** (same as gitlab — D-14 ported the slack surface 5→30;
  contract test locks flux's existing contracts; a fresh field-by-field re-audit against
  `~/projects/fluxplane/fluxplane-plugins/slack/` is a separate pass).

---

# D-38 / D-39 — gitlab + slack fluxplane parity ports (re-audit gaps closed)

The D-36 re-audit (`.flux/plans/d36-parity-audits/{gitlab,slack}.md`) confirmed D-14's "full
parity" claim was unreliable: both plugins had real feature gaps (the schemars migration had
faithfully locked flux's *gapped* contracts). All gaps are now ported from the fluxplane Go
reference. Per-op contracts updated in each `schema_contract` test; failing-first MockHost tests
per change.

## gitlab (D-38)
- `mr.merge` drift fixed: `remove_source_branch` (handler already read it, schema omitted) now in
  the struct.
- List-op pagination/filter parity: `project.list`/`mr.list`/`issue.list`/`pipeline.list` gained
  `limit`/`query`/`order_by`/`sort` + per-op filters (`mr.list` `source_branch`/`target_branch`;
  `pipeline.list` `status`/`ref`/`source`/`username`); `limit`→`per_page` in the API query.
- `index.build` selector surface: `index`/`indexes`/`entity`/`entities` + per-datasource tuning —
  a caller can index just `projects` (or `issues`/`merge_requests`) instead of all three.
- `repository.file.show` `max_bytes` (char-boundary truncate + `truncated` flag);
  `search.blobs` `max_data_bytes` (per-match snippet cap + `data_truncated`).
- Out of scope: the ~58 shared-alias cases (handler accepts `project_id`/`path`/`id`/`name`
  aliases the schema omits — intentional leniency).

## slack (D-39)
- `message.send`/`message.edit` Block Kit parity: `markdown`/`blocks`/`unfurl_links`/
  `unfurl_media`/`parse`; `text` relaxed to optional (blocks/markdown carry content). Highest-value
  fix — the model can now send Block Kit messages.
- `message.list`/`thread` `text_format` (`markdown`/`mrkdwn`/`both`); `thread` `max_bytes`
  (parsed/defaulted, not enforced — thread doesn't download images).
- `search`/`mentions` ticket extraction (`tickets`/`ticket_keys` `Vec<String>`); `mentions` `bot`.
- `file.upload` `alt_text` (was a dead param) wired in; `content_bytes` (base64 inline alt to
  `blob_ref`); `blob_ref` relaxed to optional.
- `file.download`/`download` `blob_ref` seed.
- List filters: `query`/`limit` on `file.list`/`channel.list`/`user.list`/`bookmark.list`;
  `emoji.list` `mode`/`include_aliases`. `schema_contract` gained `Kind::ArrayStr`.

Both: `endpoint_ref` + (slack) per-call `role` architectural splits left as-is (do-not-port).
